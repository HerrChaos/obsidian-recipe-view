* 🗃 Portable and future-proof markdown

Activating the recipe view
==========================
When you have the note for the recipe you want to view active, click the chef's hat icon in the ribbon or use the "Toggle recipe view and markdown view" command. To make any edits to the recipe, use either of these same methods again to return to the normal markdown editor. 

The recipe will automatically be displayed using the view format inferred from the page width and markdown content – either single column, two column, or two column with split steps. For more, see xxxxx.
