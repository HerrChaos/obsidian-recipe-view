**Why keep your recipes in Obsidian?**
- ⚡ Portable and future-proof markdown
- 📝 Everything is a note – keep your nicely formatted recipes with your scanned magazine clippings, and convert them as you go
- 🌏 Cross-link and tag your recipes, link them to notes on technique, keep a baking log in your daily notes, or use Dataview or Kanban to plan out your cooking
- ☁️ Write them on your laptop, check ingredients in the store on your phone, and cook from them in the kitchen with your iPad

## Usage
When you have the note for the recipe you want to view active, click the chef's hat icon in the ribbon. To make any edits to the recipe, you can use the back button to navigate back to the regular markdown view.

Configure in settings which sections you want to be pulled into the side column based on their headings – the default is `Ingredients|Nutrition`.

The first image in your note that is not under a heading is pulled out as a thumbnail. All properties/front matter fields in your note are displayed under the title.

The [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin will let you configure aspects of how the recipe card appears.
